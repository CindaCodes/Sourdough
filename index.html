        <h3>
          Perfecting sourdough takes patience and practice. With each bake, your
          loaves will improve! Understanding fermentation, hydration, and
          handling will help you create beautifully textured and flavorful
          bread.
        </h3>

        <h2>Caring for Your Starter</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Keep your starter active by regularly feeding it with fresh flour
            and water.
          </li>
          <li>
            If your starter has been resting in the fridge, revive it with a few
            consecutive feedings before using it for baking.
          </li>
          <li>
            Look for signs of healthâ€”bubbles, a tangy aroma, and doubling in
            size after feeding indicate a strong, active starter.
          </li>
          <li>
            Avoid contamination by always using clean utensils and storing your
            starter in a breathable container.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Temperature Control</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Track the temperature of your dough to ensure it ferments properly.
            Warmer environments speed up fermentation, while cooler environments
            slow it down.
          </li>
          <li>
            Adjust the water temperature based on room conditions to maintain
            consistent fermentation.
          </li>
          <li>
            If proofing in a cooler kitchen, use a proofing box or a slightly
            warm oven (with the light on) to maintain an optimal temperature.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Hydration & Handling</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Higher hydration doughs (above 75%) yield an open crumb but require
            careful handling to maintain structure.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use the "slap and fold" or "coil fold" techniques to build gluten
            strength without overworking the dough.
          </li>
          <li>
            If dough feels too sticky, lightly wet your hands instead of adding
            extra flour, which can alter hydration ratios.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Essential Techniques</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Stretch & Fold:</strong> Perform stretch-and-folds
            throughout bulk fermentation to develop gluten strength.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Autolyse:</strong> Let flour and water rest before adding
            salt and starterâ€”this improves hydration and dough extensibility.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Pre-shaping & Final Shaping:</strong> Pre-shaping helps
            build structure before the final shaping stage, ensuring a better
            rise.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Cold Proofing:</strong> Retarding dough in the fridge
            overnight enhances flavor and improves oven spring.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Essential Supplies</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>

        <h2>Steps to Making Sourdough</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>1. Prepare Your Starter:</strong> Ensure your sourdough
            starter is active by feeding it before mixing your dough.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2. Mix the Dough:</strong> Combine flour, water, and
            starter. Let it rest before adding salt.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>3. Autolyse & Bulk Fermentation:</strong> Allow the flour
            and water to absorb fully before fermentation begins. Stretch and
            fold the dough every 30-45 minutes over 3-4 hours.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>4. Pre-shape & Bench Rest:</strong> Lightly shape your dough
            and let it rest to relax the gluten.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>5. Final Shaping & Proofing:</strong> Shape the dough into a
            boule or batard and let it proof.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>6. Preheat & Bake:</strong> Preheat your oven with a Dutch
            oven or baking stone. Bake covered for 20 minutes, then uncovered
            for another 20-25 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>7. Cool & Enjoy:</strong> Let your sourdough cool completely
            on a wire rack before slicing to allow the crumb to set.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Health Benefits</h1>
        <h3>
          Sourdough bread is not only delicious but also packed with health
          benefits, including better digestion, improved blood sugar levels, and
          fewer preservatives. Thanks to its unique fermentation process, it is
          often easier to digest and provides a range of nutritional advantages
          over conventional bread.
        </h3>

        <h2>Improved Digestion</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Prebiotics:</strong> The fermentation process produces
            prebiotics that nourish your gut bacteria and aid in digestion,
            promoting overall gut health.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Protein Breakdown:</strong> Fermentation breaks down protein
            structures, including gluten, making sourdough easier on the
            digestive system.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Starch Breakdown:</strong> The yeast and bacteria in
            sourdough partially digest starches before they enter the stomach,
            reducing bloating and discomfort for some people.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Low FODMAP Benefits:</strong> The extended fermentation
            process reduces levels of fermentable short-chain carbohydrates
            (FODMAPs), which can trigger digestive issues in individuals with
            IBS (Irritable Bowel Syndrome).
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Blood Sugar Control</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Low Glycemic Index:</strong> Sourdough bread causes a
            slower, more gradual rise in blood sugar levels compared to other
            types of bread, reducing insulin spikes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Better Nutrient Absorption:</strong> The lactic acid
            bacteria in sourdough help neutralize phytic acid, which can block
            mineral absorption, allowing your body to absorb more nutrients from
            the bread.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Gluten Sensitivity</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Gluten Breakdown:</strong> The slow fermentation process
            helps break down gluten proteins, making it easier to digest for
            those with mild gluten intolerance.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Lower Gluten Content:</strong> While not gluten-free,
            properly fermented sourdough often contains lower gluten levels
            compared to conventional bread, which may be beneficial for those
            with non-celiac gluten sensitivity.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Gut Health</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Prebiotics & Postbiotics:</strong> While the live bacteria
            in sourdough are mostly killed during baking, the fermentation
            process still produces postbioticsâ€”beneficial byproducts such as
            organic acids and peptides that support gut health. Additionally,
            sourdough contains prebiotics, which serve as food for the good
            bacteria already present in your gut, helping to maintain a balanced
            microbiome.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Reduced Antinutrients:</strong> Fermentation lowers phytic
            acid levels, which can interfere with nutrient absorption, making
            sourdough a more bioavailable source of essential minerals like
            magnesium, zinc, and iron.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Heart Health</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Reduces Inflammation:</strong> The fermentation process
            creates beneficial compounds that may help lower inflammation, a key
            factor in heart disease.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Cholesterol Support:</strong> Some studies suggest that
            sourdough bread may help improve cholesterol levels, reducing the
            risk of cardiovascular issues.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Rich in Antioxidants</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Lower Oxidative Stress:</strong> Sourdough contains
            antioxidants such as ferulic acid and phenolic compounds, which help
            combat cell damage and may reduce the risk of chronic diseases.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Supports Immune Function:</strong> Antioxidants contribute
            to a stronger immune system by reducing free radical damage.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Higher in Essential Nutrients</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>More B Vitamins:</strong> Fermentation boosts levels of B
            vitamins, including folate and riboflavin, which support energy
            production and cell function.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Enhanced Mineral Content:</strong> Sourdough provides
            bioavailable forms of iron, magnesium, and zinc, essential for
            overall health.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Natural Preservation</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Acetic Acid:</strong> Sourdough contains acetic acid, which
            helps prevent mold from forming naturally, extending the bread's
            shelf life without artificial preservatives.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Lower Additives:</strong> Unlike commercial breads,
            traditional sourdough often contains just flour, water, and salt,
            avoiding artificial preservatives and additives.
          </li>
        </ul>
